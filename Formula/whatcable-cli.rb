  def install
    # The CLI uses Swift's Bundle.module to load a bundled SQLite cable DB
    # and the USB-IF vendor list. Bundle.module's lookup is anchored at
    # Bundle.main.resourceURL, which is the directory of the running
    # binary's real path. If we symlinked bin/whatcable -> libexec/whatcable,
    # the process would launch with bin/whatcable as its path and Bundle.module
    # would look for the resource bundle in bin/ rather than libexec/. Using
    # write_exec_script makes Homebrew drop a wrapper that exec's the libexec
    # binary, so the process starts with its real path and the lookup works.
    libexec.install "whatcable", "WhatCable_WhatCableCore.bundle", "TUIkit_TUIkit.bundle", "Info.plist"
    bin.write_exec_script libexec/"whatcable"
